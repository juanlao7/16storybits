Since [the Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/juanlao/i-told-you-a-new-tactical-action-adventure){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to fund the development **I told you** failed to reach its goal, the project has been cancelled.

The development might be resumed someday if a significant number of users wishlist the game on Steam.
