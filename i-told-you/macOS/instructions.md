# I told you [DEMO] on macOS

This *beta* package is available on the following platforms:

* [itch.io](https://16-story-bits.itch.io/i-told-you){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* [GameJolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/i-told-you/525050){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* [IndieDB](TODO_LINK_ARCHIVO){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

macOS will prevent you from running this package, because it is not signed and notarized.

If [the Kickstarter campaign](https://rebrand.ly/itoldyou-kickstarter-not-ready){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for funding the development of <span class="nowrap">***I told you***</span> reaches its goal, I will buy a Mac and properly sign, notarize and test the full game.

Meanwhile, in order to run this prelaunch demo, please follow these steps:
