# I told you [DEMO] on macOS

This package is currently in *beta*, and it is available on the following platforms:

* [itch.io](https://16-story-bits.itch.io/i-told-you){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* [GameJolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/i-told-you/525050){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* [IndieDB](TODO_LINK_ARCHIVO){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

The first thing you will notice is that macOS will prevent you from running this package because it is not signed and notarized.

This package is not signed and notarized because I still do not have a Mac. If [the Kickstarter campaign](https://rebrand.ly/itoldyou-kickstarter-not-ready){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for funding the development of ***I told you*** reaches its goal, I will buy a Mac and properly sign, notarize and test the full game.

Meanwhile, in order to run this prelaunch demo, follow these steps:

Open *System Preferences* and click on "Security & Privacy".
